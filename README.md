## SpaceX StarKicker - cutting down on travel time to Mars

The idea is to use a SpaceX special desiged Starship (called here StarKicker) to provide additional
delta V to the departing to mars crewed Starship. Once launched, the StarKicker will always stay
in orbit. The StarKicker is basen on expendable version of SpaceX's Starship but needs neither
the nosecone nor the cargo bay. Both the nosecone and the cargo bay should be ditched during
the launch. It utilize standard 9m ring docking port, that is used to connect SuperHeavy
with the StarShip on accent from earth.
